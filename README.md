# TelegramBot
A very simple Telegram bot using Dart and TeleDart
  
# Info
It uses my [CommandHandler](https://github.com/theKAKAN/CommandHandler) library for handling commands.  
Commands are located inside ```lib/main.dart```, but you can put them where you wish  
I made it as a fun project( _as I had nothing to do for an hour_ ) and so, I don't think I'll return to improve it any time soon.

# Usage
Run ```pub get``` to download the dependencies  
Open ```lib/main.dart``` and replace ```YOUR-BOT-TOKEN``` with the token you received from BotFather  
Enjoy and make your own commands :)
